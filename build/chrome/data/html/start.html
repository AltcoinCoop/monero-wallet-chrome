        <p class="left">
          This wallet aims to make Monero's official simplewallet a joy to use, combining a visually appealing interface with a high degree of functionality.
          In fact, this wallet is not actually a wallet at all, but rather a layer on top of simplewallet to allow you to use Monero's official command line wallet in an easy and fun.
        </p>
          
        <p class="left">
          Before continuing, if you do not have simplewallet installed, download it from <a target="_blank" href="https://getmonero.org/downloads/">getmonero.org</a>.

            To use this extension, you need to have simplewallet running in rpc mode on the same machine as your Chrome or Chromium browser.
            You can choose to set this up yourself, or download a script written by the author of this extension to handle that for you.

              This walkthrough will teach you how to run simplewallet, first as the regular command line wallet, and then in rpc mode.
              It assumes you are brand new to simplewallet and do not have a wallet currently installed.
              If you want to use a wallet that you have installed previously, you can probably skip some steps and modify basic commands to fit your need.
            
            <h3 class="left">Initializing a new wallet</h3>
            <p class="left">
              To run simplewallet in rpc mode, you first need to have an initialized and synced wallet.
              If you do not have this yet, we recommend that you make a new directory to hold your wallet.
              Open "Finder" and navigate to your main user directory.
              Now create a new folder and call it "MoneroWallet".
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              To make simplewallet easiest to run, you should put it into your new directory.
              Assuming you just downloaded the official Monero OS X applications, unzip that folder and copy "simplewallet" into your new "MoneroWallet" directory.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Now that you've done some prep work, open the "Terminal" app.
              The easiest way to find it if you are having trouble is to use the hotkey "cmnd"+"spacebar", and then type "Terminal" in the search menu.
              We are going to navigate to your new "MoneroWallet" directory, and then open simplewallet.
              In the terminal, type the following, and then hit enter.
              See the following note regarding "--daemon-address".
            </p>
            <p class="terminal">
              cd ~/MoneroWallet <br>
              ./simplewallet --daemon-address node.moneroclub.com:8880
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Here we have told simplewallet to connect to a "remote node", hosted by a member of the Monero community over the internet.
              It is safe to use such nodes from a security standpoint - node operators do not and cannot know your wallet's secret keys.
              However, using a remote node does lose some privacy, as the remote node operator can see some of your activity that would normally be hidden.
              If you want full privacy, you can connect to your own node.
              If that node is on the same computer as simplewallet, you can omit the "--daemon-address ..." flag.
              Running your own node is not covered here, but help is available on <a target="_blank" href="https://getmonero.org/getting-started/running">getmonero.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Once you run the commands above, simplewallet should start. It will prompt you for a wallet name and password.
              For this tutorial, we'll use "MoneroWallet.bin" as the wallet name and "xxxx" as the password.
              Please pick your own stronger password and be sure to write it down somewhere safe!
              Then choose the language you want to use.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              At this point, simplewallet will generate a new wallet for you.
              If you look in your directory, you will see a number of files, including "MoneroWallet.bin", "MoneroWallet.bin.address.txt", and "MoneroWallet.bin.keys".
              These files are the core of your wallet.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              In the terminal, you will see that simplewallet has provided you with a number of pieces of information.
              Please read through this, and write down the 25 word "seed" that it gives you for safe keeping.
              If your wallet ever becomes corrupt, all you ever need to restore it is that seed.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              There is only one thing left to do before being able to switch to the extension wallet.
              Simplewallet should have told you to type "refresh" to get your wallet going. Do that now.
            </p>
            <p class="terminal">
              refresh
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              This will begin to scan Monero's blockchain for your wallet and bring you up to date.
              This may take some time, especially if you are using a remote node.
              Once it is done, simplewallet will tell you it is up to date and display a balance.
              You can now exit the wallet.
            <p>
            <p class="terminal">
              exit
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="left">Running a wallet in rpc mode</h3>
            <p class=left">
              Once you have an initialized wallet, you can launch simplewallet in rpc mode to interact with the Monero Wallet extension.
              In the Terminal, launch simplewallet with the following commands (again including "--daemon-address ..." if you want to connect to the moneroclub.com remote node).
            <p>
            <p class="terminal">
              ./simplewallet --wallet-file MoneroWallet.bin --password xxxx --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --rpc-bind-port 18082 --daemon-address node.moneroclub.com:8880
            <p>
            <p class="left">
              Simplewallet will now be running in rpc mode.
              Note that if you try to type anything into the terminal, simplewallet does not respond.
              This is because rpc mode disables interactive mode.
              In addition, you cannot close the terminal without closing simplewallet.
              If you want to be able to close the wallet, we recommend using the "screen" command.
              This is not covered in the tutorial, but can be easily searched for online looking for something like "screen command osx"
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Now check your chrome extension to see if it is connected online!

            <p class="left">
              To make launching simplewallet as simple and straightforward as possible, we have created an easy-to-use launcher script.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              First, download the script.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Now, open the Finder and navigate to Applications.
              Make a new folder in Applications called "MoneroWallet".
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Copy both the downloaded script "MoneroWallet.command" and simplewallet into your new MoneroWallet folder.
              It is important that this folder is located at exactly "/Applications/MoneroWallet".
            </p>
            
            <h4 class="left"> Running the script for the first time, setting up a new wallet. </h4>
            <p class="left">
              Double-click "MoneroWallet.command".
              The script will launch in a new Terminal window and display a message.
              Follow the dialog, choosing a password and other options.
              Unless you have your own Monero node running or want to specify a specific node, choose the "remote" option when prompted.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Once you have chosen all of your settings, simplewallet will generate a new wallet for you and tell you a secret 25 word "seed".
              Write down your seed and keep it safe and private. This seed is all you ever need to restore a corrupt or lost wallet.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              There is only one thing left to do before being able to switch to the extension wallet.

              Once it is done, simplewallet will tell you it is up to date and display a balance.
              You can now exit the wallet by typing "exit".

            <h4 class="left">Running the script all future times after setup</h4>
            <p class="left">
              After you run the script for the first time, using the script in the future is much easier.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Double-click the "MoneroWallet.command" file again.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              This time, the script will ask you to enter the wallet you chose before and pick a node.
              Then it will launch simplewallet in rpc mode, and give you some feedback.
              Once finished, you can safely exit the script by typing "exit" or hitting the "x" button in the top left.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Now check your chrome extension to see if it is connected online!

            </p>
            <p class="left">
              You can turn off your wallet from the extension by clicking "Stop Wallet" in the extension's menu.
              If you do this, you will need to re-launch the script to use the extension again later.

              Make sure you are in your make user directory, then make a new folder called "MoneroWallet". Type:
            </p>
            <p class="terminal">
              cd ~/ <br>
              mkdir MoneroWallet
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Copy both the downloaded script "MoneroWallet" and simplewallet into your new MoneroWallet folder.
              It is important that this folder is located at exactly "~/MoneroWallet".
            </p>
            
            <h4 class="left"> Running the script for the first time, setting up a new wallet. </h4>
            <p class="left">
              In the Terminal, navigate to your new folder.
              Then run the Monero Simplewallet Launcher script:
            </p>
            <p class="terminal">
              cd ~/MoneroWallet <br>
              ./MoneroWallet
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              The script will launch a dialog for creating a new wallet.
              Follow the dialog, choosing a password and other options.
              Unless you have your own Monero node running or want to specify a specific node, choose the "remote" option when prompted.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Once you have chosen all of your settings, simplewallet will generate a new wallet for you and tell you a secret 25 word "seed".
              Write down your seed and keep it safe and private. This seed is all you ever need to restore a corrupt or lost wallet.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              There is only one thing left to do before being able to switch to the extension wallet.
              Simplewallet should have told you to type "refresh" to get your wallet going. Do that now.
            </p>
            <p class="terminal">
              refresh
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              This will begin to scan Monero's blockchain for your wallet and bring you up to date.
              This may take some time, especially if you are using a remote node.
              Once it is done, simplewallet will tell you it is up to date and display a balance.
              You can now exit the wallet by typing "exit".
            <p>
            <p class="terminal">
              exit
            </p>
            
            <h4 class="left">Running the script all future times after setup</h4>
            <p class="left">
              After you run the script for the first time, using the script in the future is much easier.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              In the Terminal, navigate to your new folder.
              Then run the Monero Simplewallet Launcher script:
            </p>
            <p class="terminal">
              cd ~/MoneroWallet <br>
              ./MoneroWallet
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              This time, the script will ask you to enter the wallet you chose before and pick a node.
              Then it will launch simplewallet in rpc mode, and give you some feedback.
              Once finished, you can safely exit the script by typing "exit" or hitting the "x" button in the Terminal window.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              Now check your chrome extension to see if it is connected online!
              Click the extension icon in the upper right of your browser to open the extension popup.
            </p>
            <p class="left">
              You can turn off your wallet from the extension by clicking "Stop Wallet" in the extension's menu.
              If you do this, you will need to re-launch the script to use the extension again later.
